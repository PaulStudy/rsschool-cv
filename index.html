        <p> I am a beginner programmer who wants to make money freelancing. For this I came to RSS to get basic skills
            and a deeper understanding of this subject The only thing I know from programming languages - Q-basic</p>
        <p> As such, I do not know how to work experience, I unlearned to become a programmer of CNC machines, which is
            not applicable to frontend or freelance as such. From the code examples, I can only cite signal modulation,
            but it will not be relevant to the topic.</p>
        <p> My English is at an extremely low level</p>
